The filter is made of a smooth metal material, likely steel or aluminum, which gives it a sturdy and durable appearance.

This filter has a tall and elongated shape, resembling a drum or a large spool, and is primarily composed of a cream or off-white paper-like filtration material, tightly pleated to increase surface area for filtration efficiency.\n\nThe top and bottom ends of the cartridge are capped with a light beige plastic material. The top cap features a central circular opening, which likely serves as the inlet or outlet for fluid or air, and the edges of the cap have a slightly grooved design for structural reinforcement.\n\nAccompanying the filter cartridge are three black rubber O-rings of varying sizes. These O-rings appear to be sealing gaskets that are used together with the filter cartridge, ensuring a tight fit and preventing leakage when the filter is installed.\n\nThere are no visible logos on the filter cartridge, so no branding can be replaced with \"UNITRUCK ®\" in this description. The overall design is functional and industrial, suitable for use in machinery or vehicles requiring fluid or air filtration. ##Studio Background Description – Mechanic Car Shop Style (Product-Focused) The setting evokes the authentic atmosphere of a modern automotive workshop, carefully staged to complement—not compete with—the product in focus.
